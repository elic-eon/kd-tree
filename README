class KDTree
  1. void insert2D(double, double, char *)
    You can insert a pair (x , y) into the 2D-tree
    Example :
      tree1.insert2D(1, 2, "A")
    means you insert a point A (1, 2)in 2D space into tree
  2. KDIterator& nearest2D(double, double)
    If you have inserted some points in the 2D-Tree
    You can get the neatest point between whichever point you want
    Example :
      tree1.insert2D(1, 2, "A"), tree1.insert2D(-1, 3, "B"), ....
      tree1.nearest2D(0, 0)`
    It will return a KDIterator point the nearest point
  3. void clear()
    You can use the function to clear all point in the tree
    Example :
      tree1.clear()

class KDIterator
  1. void show()
    You can use this function to print a point
    Example :
      KDIterator nearest = tree.nearest2D(0, 0);
      nearest.show();
    it will pintf A( x, y ) or other depend on your tree

Other function
  1. double dis(double, double, KDIterator&)
    This function can calculate distence between two points
    Example :
      KDIterator nearest = tree.nearest2D(0, 0);
      double distence = dis(0, 0, nearest);
